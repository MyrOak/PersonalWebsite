## SASIE

### **Sensory Assessment System with Spatial Information - (SASIE)**

<div style="text-align:justify;">
The acronym SASIE comes from the Portuguese name "Sistema de Avaliação Sensorial com Informações Espaciais." SASIE aims to estimate quality indices by considering spatial correlation structures generated by spherical, Gaussian, and exponential models. The parameter estimates related to range and nugget effect are incorporated into the index construction, accounting for the linear and quadratic model adjustments.

<div style="text-align:justify;">
**Data Input**: Data input follows the layout shown to the side, where the first two columns represent the horizontal and vertical coordinates. The third column, exemplified as (Score), refers to a sensory attribute being evaluated for quality. Optionally, the user can upload a .txt or .csv file. Once the data is uploaded, the user can proceed to the estimation of quality indices.
